            <h2>C++</h2>
            <p>C++ stands as one of the most powerful and influential programming languages in the world, a language
                that has shaped software development for decades and continues to be at the heart of many of the
                technologies we rely on today. Created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s as an extension of the C
                programming language, C++ was designed to bring the power of object-oriented programming to the
                efficiency and control of C.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is the backbone of modern web development, an essential and powerful language that brings
                interactivity, dynamism, and life to the websites and applications we use every day. From humble
                beginnings in the 1990s as a scripting language for simple animations and form validation, JavaScript
                has evolved into a robust, multi-paradigm language that powers everything from responsive user
                interfaces to full-stack applications.</p>

            <h2>Python</h2>
            <p>Python is a versatile and powerful programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
                Developed by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, Python has become a cornerstone for many areas of
                software development, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and scripting.
